Ray tracer for a graphics class I took as a senior.

This is very unpolished C++ code produced by me years ago.

I'm proud of the project, not of the code quality.

To run this:
make
./lab6 scenes/some_scene_file.txt
convert -quality 100 output.ppm output.jpg
open output.jpg

Some of the features include:
  - Reflections
  - Glossiness
  - Refractions (sort of)
  - Translucency
  - Several types of lighting (point, directional, spot)
  - Depth of field view
  - Anti-aliasing
  - Textures
  - Shadows (soft and hard)
  - Concave/convex triangulated polyhedra
  - Phong smooth shading

Description of some of the included scene files:

flat.txt:
    Standard cuboid, flat shaded.

smooth.txt:
    Smoothed version of flat.txt.

checkers.txt:
    Shows a simple texture (checkers) applied to a 
    triangulated object as well as a non uniform scale and 
    rotate.

concave.txt:
    Shows a simple concave polygon.

concaveshadow.txt:
    This file is similar to concave.txt but I wanted
    to submit a clear demonstration of concave objects
    casting shadoow on themselves.
