Included test file:

flat.txt:
    Standard cuboid, flat shaded.

smooth.txt:
    Smoothed version of flat.txt.

checkers.txt:
    Shows a simple texture (checkers) applied to a 
    triangulated object as well as a non uniform scale and 
    rotate.

concave.txt:
    Shows a simple concave polygon.

concaveshadow.txt:
    This file is similar to concave.txt but I wanted
    to submit a clear demonstration of concave objects
    casting shadoow on themselves.
